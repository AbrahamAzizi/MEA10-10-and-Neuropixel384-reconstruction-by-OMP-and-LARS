# Model-based Compressive Sensing implementation: OMP and LARS
A tensorflow pipline for signal reconstruction of recording data from MEA10*10 and neuropixel384 by OMP and LARS is explored.<br>
The resolution increases by rising the number of measurements.<br>
If the number of measurements is critical, one can perform denoising postprocessing to increase the resolution.<br>
