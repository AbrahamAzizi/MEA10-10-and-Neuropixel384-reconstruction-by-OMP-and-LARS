# Model-based Compressive Sensing implementation: OMP and LARS
In this notebook signal reconstruction of recording data from MEA10*10 and neuropixel384 by OMP and LARS is explored.
The resolution increases by rising the number of measurements.
If the number of measurements is critical, one can do the denoising postprocessing to increase the resolution.
